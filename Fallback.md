# Fallback

## How to beat this level?

You will beat this level if

1. you claim ownership of the contract
2. you reduce its balance to 0

### A bit of Solidity theory on fallback and receive functions

#### Advanced
When another contract or Externally Owner Address (EOA) calls the func
- talk about different things that make these functions like payable, external, no actual function name
- talk about different ways a call can be made to fall back (like via call function or send or transfer)
- gas
- explain painpoints of fall back and why receive was added to solidity
- explain why its good to use contact functions that use the abi

#### Basic


### Real World Example
