## What makes something random?

A random event is an event that outcome can not be easily predicted. The resistance of a probabilistic scenario from artificial tampering. You cannot 100% determine the result of a coin flip or the 2050  nba champion. These random events rely on a variety of factors that increases the entropy in each system.

## Why is randomness difficult reproduce on the blockchain?

The blockchain by nature is deterministic - the hash of each block is based on the hash of the previous blocks before it. (If bad actor manipulate the previous block then the current blocks hash will consequently change).This is good for maintaining the integrity of the distributed ledger but this publicness of all code published to the blockchain is bad for using internal blockchain properties a the basis for randomness in a scenario. Creating randomness in a computer requires the creation of a randomness factor that varies. For exampe, block.number is a property that some contracts use as a source of randomness. But block.number is public and so if knowing the block.number was the crux of randomness then the eventsâ€™ outcome will be rendered deterministic.
